        Donâ€™t you just hate it when you run a simulation on a remote server and
        you have no way of knowing how long it's gonna take, so you just wait
        there and hope that it finishes before the end of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        And let's say even if you have something like
        <a href="https://tqdm.github.io/">tqdm</a> or some time counter in
        place, and you have to leave your set up, go out somewhere, you still
        feel anxious.
      </p>
      <p>I go through the same struggle, so I present to you, STAR.</p>
      <p>
        STAR lets you monitor the progress of your simulation and/or? lets you
        know when it crashes on either your phone via
        <a href="https://discord.com/">DISCORD</a> (app) or this website
        (responsive).
